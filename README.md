## Statistical-Project
## This is my course project in mathematical statistics last semester
 The problem I am trying to solve in this report is the prediction of house price based on its characteristics and features. The traditional house pricing methods are based on the discount of cash flow and comparison method. However, the approach I adopt to solve the problem is regression models. The description of dataset and the graphs can help you to have a better overview of this problem. Then I use several methods to constructthemodels, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso and Elastic Net. By comparing the prediction mean squared error , we find that the performance of Elastic Net is better than others, because it works well in the situation with colinearity. Finally, I analyze and explain the feature of these models in detail.
